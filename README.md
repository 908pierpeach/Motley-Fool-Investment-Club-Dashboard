# Portfolio Performance & Risk Dashboard
## Overview

This repository showcases a **Portfolio Performance and Risk Dashboard** built for the **Berea College Motley Fool Investment Club**, a student-managed investment fund responsible for portfolio monitoring, risk oversight, and performance reporting.

The dashboard was developed in **Power BI** and used internally for ongoing portfolio review and Board-level reporting. Due to organizational access restrictions, a static **PNG export** is included here to demonstrate the structure, analytics, and visual design of the dashboard.
